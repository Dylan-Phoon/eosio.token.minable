# eosio.token.minable

Standard for minable tokens on eos.
Allows for fairer distribution than just airdrops to the genesis snapshot alone.

TODO:
* ReadMe: Add in descriptions for all of the hashing functions and how everything works etc.
* Contract: Implement the difficulty adjustment algo (need to find a way to perform arithmetic on 256 bit integer).
